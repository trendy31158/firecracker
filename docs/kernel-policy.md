# Firecracker's Kernel Support Policy

Firecracker is tightly coupled with the guest and host kernels on which it is
run. This document presents our kernel support policy which aims to help our
customers choose host and guest OS configuration, and predict future kernel
related changes.

We are continuously validating the currently supported Firecracker releases (as
per [Firecrackerâ€™s release policy](../docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md)) using a
combination of:

- host linux kernel versions 4.14, 5.10, and 6.1;
- guest linux kernel versions 4.14, and 5.10.

While other versions and other kernel configs might work, they are not
periodically validated in our test suite, and using them might result in
unexpected behaviour. Starting with release `v1.0` each major and minor release
will specify the supported kernel versions.

Once a kernel version is officially enabled, it is supported for a **minimum of
2 years**. Adding support for a new kernel version will result in a Firecracker
release only if compatibility changes are required.

| Host kernel | Guest kernel v4.14 | Guest kernel v5.10 | Min. end of support |
| ----------: | :----------------: | :----------------: | ------------------: |
|       v4.14 |          Y         |          Y         |          2021-01-22 |
|       v5.10 |          Y         |          Y         |          2024-01-31 |
|        v6.1 |          Y         |          Y         |          2025-10-12 |

The guest kernel configs used in our validation pipelines can be found
[here](../resources/guest_configs/) while a breakdown of the relevant guest
kernel modules can be found in the next section.

## Guest kernel configuration items

The configuration items that may be relevant for Firecracker are:

- serial console - `CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE`, `CONFIG_PRINTK`
- initrd support - `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD`
- virtio devices - `CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO`
  - balloon - `CONFIG_MEMORY_BALLOON`, `CONFIG_VIRTIO_BALLOON`
  - block - `CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK`
    - partuuid support - `CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION`
  - network - `CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET`
  - vsock - `CONFIG_VIRTIO_VSOCKETS`
  - entropy - `CONFIG_HW_RANDOM_VIRTIO`
- guest RNG - `CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU`
  - use CPU RNG instructions (if present) to initialize RNG. Available for >=
    5.10

There are also guest config options which are dependant on the platform on which
Firecracker is run:

### ARM

- timekeeping - `CONFIG_ARM_AMBA`, `CONFIG_RTC_DRV_PL031`
- serial console - `CONFIG_SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM`

### x86_64

- timekeeping - `CONFIG_KVM_GUEST` (which enables CONFIG_KVM_CLOCK)
- high precision timekeeping - `CONFIG_PTP_1588_CLOCK`,
  `CONFIG_PTP_1588_CLOCK_KVM`
- external clean shutdown - `CONFIG_SERIO_I8042`, `CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD`
- virtio devices - `CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO_CMDLINE_DEVICES`

#### Minimal boot requirements

Depending on the source of boot (either from a block device or from an initrd),
the minimal configuration for a guest kernel for a successful microVM boot is:

- Booting with initrd:

  - `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y`
    - aarch64 `CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO=y` (for the serial device).
    - x86_64 `CONFIG_KVM_GUEST=y`.

- Booting with root block device:

  - aarch64
    - `CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK=y`
  - x86_64
    - `CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK=y`
    - `CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO_CMDLINE_DEVICES=y`
    - `CONFIG_KVM_GUEST=y`.

*Optional*: To enable boot logs set `CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y` and
`CONFIG_PRINTK=y` in the guest kernel config.

## Caveats

- When using a 4.14 host and a 5.10 guest, we disable the SVE extension in the
  guest. This is due to the introduction of the SVE extension in Graviton3,
  which causes the default 5.10 guest (with SVE support enabled), to crash if
  run with a 4.14 host which does not support SVE.
