This file implements functionality for generating reports.

A report typically consists of what tests have been executed, the type of test,
what functionality it validates, what is the criteria that we use to validate
and an optional link to a GitHub issue.

To pick up all the items listed above, this module defines the `Report` class
which is responsible for gathering data on what tests have been executed,
extracting test information and generating the report.

While some items such as test name can be extracted directly from code, others
such as test type or issue link are extracted from the function docstring.
A test docstring is defined like below:
    def test_net_device():
        """
        Test description
        @type: regression
        @issue: https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1
        """

    return "Actual value: 8", "Maximum value: 10"

On the first line we define the test description. Each subsequent item is
defined by specifying a token enclosed by '@' and ':'. None of these tokens
is mandatory to be defined in the docstring. If the token is missing, the
report may contain the default value or no value at all.

Since we also want to store what test criteria we're targetting for a test to
pass, the framework picks up the values returned by each test to report this
data.

The format used for returning the test criteria is a tuple, with the first
element being the actual value or result and the second one being the checked
limits.

For example, for the test above the reported criteria would be
    'Maximum value: 10'
While the test result would be:
    'Actual value: 8'

The test framework does not do any comparison here, so it's the users
responsibility to properly report these values.
