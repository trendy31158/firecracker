"""
Defines utilities for performing A/B-tests.

A/B-Tests are style of tests where we do not care what state a test is in, but only that this state does not change
across a pull request. This is useful if
1. Validating the state requires some baseline to be persisted in the repository, and maintaining this baseline
   adds significant operational burden (for example, performance tests), or
2. The state can change due to outside factors (e.g. Hardware changes), and such external changes would block all
   pull requests until they are resolved.

Consider for example a `cargo audit` tests, which is used to reject usage of dependency versinos that have known
security vulnerabilities, or which have been yanked. The "state" here is "list of vulnerable dependencies". Clearly,
this can change due to external action (a new vulnerability is discovered and published to RustSec). At this point,
every PR would fail until this dependency is removed, blocking all development. Simply removing the test from PR CI
is not an option, since we want to avoid the scenario where a PR adds a dependency with a known vulnerability (e.g.
the PR itself changes the "list of vulnerable dependencies"). A/B-Testing allows us to not block PRs on the former case,
while still preventing the latter: We run cargo audit twice, once on main HEAD, and once on the PR HEAD. If the output
of both invocations is the same, the test passes (with us being alerted to this situtation via a special pipeline that
does not block PRs). If not, it fails, preventing PRs from introducing new vulnerable dependencies.

    permutes the two populations (e.g. merges them and then randomly splits them again). For each such permuted
