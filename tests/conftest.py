"""Imported by pytest at the start of every test session.

# Fixture Goals

Fixtures herein are made available to every test collected by pytest. They are
designed with the following goals in mind:
- Running a test on a microvm is as easy as importing a microvm fixture.
- Adding a new microvm image (kernel, rootfs) for tests to run on is as easy as
  uploading that image to a key-value store, e.g., an s3 bucket.

# Solution

- Keep microvm test images in an S3 bucket, structured as follows:

``` tree
s3://<bucket-url>/img/
    <microvm_test_image_folder_n>/
        kernel/
            <optional_kernel_name.>vmlinux.bin
        fsfiles/
            <rootfs_name>rootfs.ext4
            <other_fsfile_n>
            ...
        <other_resource_n>
        ...
    ...
```

- Tag `<microvm_test_image_folder_n>` with the capabilities of that image:

``` json
TagSet = [{"key": "capability:<cap_name>", "value": ""}, ...]
```

- Make available fixtures that expose microvms based on any given capability.
  For example, a test function using the fixture `test_microvm_any` should run
  on all microvm images in the S3 bucket, while a test using the fixture
  `test_microvm_with_net` should only run on the microvm images tagged with
  `capability:net`. Note that a test function that uses a parameterized fixture
  will yield one test case for every possible parameter of that fixture. For
  example, using `test_microvm_any` in a test will create as many test cases
  as there are microvm images in the S3 bucket.

- Provide fixtures that simplify other common testing operations, like http
  over local unix domain sockets.

# Example

```
def test_with_any_microvm(test_microvm_any):

    response = test_microvm_any.machine_cfg.put(
        vcpu_count=8
    )
    assert(test_microvm_any.api_session.is_good_response(response.status_code))

    # [...]

    response = test_microvm_any.actions.put(action_type='InstanceStart')
    assert(test_microvm_any.api_session.is_good_response(response.status_code))
```

The test above makes use of the "any" test microvm fixture, so this test will
be run on every microvm image in the bucket, each as a separate test case.

# Notes

- Reading up on pytest fixtures is probably needed when editing this file.

# TODO

- A fixture that wraps `subprocess.run('<command>, shell=True, check=True)`,
  and also controls output verbosity by appending `>/dev/null [&2>1]`.
- A fixture that allows per-test-function dependency installation.
- Support generating fixtures with more than one capability. This is supported
  by the MicrovmImageFetcher, but not by the fixture template.
